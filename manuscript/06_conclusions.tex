The curation of published \covid-specific TCRs datasets allowed the measurement of the response to \covid{} antigens in disease and vaccination, showing that COVID-19 convalescent subjects are immunized against several viral antigens, while vaccine immunization is restricted to the spike protein. Sequence similarity network analysis has the potential to discern between true TCR responses and unspecific cross-reactivities, but its relevance should be further studied. The titanic effort of the scientific community towards the understanding of \covid{} immunology will continue to provide useful immune repertoire data to establish accurate \covid{} immunization TCR biomarkers.
